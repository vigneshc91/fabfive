                Equity share is a main source of finance for any company giving investors rights to vote, share profits and claim on assets. Various types of equity capital are authorized, issued, subscribed, paid up, rights, bonus, sweat equity etc. The value of equity shares are expressed in terms of face value or par value, issue price, book value, market value etc.
            </p>

                In the world of financial and investment management, ‘equity share’ is a big word frequently used in every next discussion. We call it stock, ordinary share, or shares, all are one and the same. Explaining equity shares in a page or a bunch of pages is very difficult. Let us still try to define it in as summarized manner as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Equity share is one of the main sources of finance for any company. Normally, a company is started with equity shares as its first source of capital from the owners or promoters of that company. After a certain level of growth, more capital is required for further growth.The company then finds an investor in the form of friends, relatives, venture capitalists, mutual funds, or any such small group of investors and issue fresh equity shares to these investors.
            </p>
            <p>
                A point comes where the company reaches a very big level and requires huge capital investment for business growth. It then offers its equity share to the general public. This is called Initial Public Offer (IPO). More such issues in future are called Follow-on Public Offer (FPO).
            </p>
            <p>
                They are categorized under long-term sources of finance because legally they are irredeemable in nature. For an investor, these shares are a certificate of ownership in the company by virtue of which investors are entitled to share the net profits and have a residual claim over the assets of the company in the event of liquidation. Investors have voting rights in the company and their liability to the company is limited to the amount of investment.

                An equity investment generally refers to the buying and holding of shares of stock on a stock market by individuals and firms in anticipation of income from dividends and capital gains. Typically, equity holders receive voting rights, meaning that they can vote on candidates for the board of directors (shown on a diversification of the fund(s) and to obtain the skill of the professional fund managers in charge of the fund(s). An alternative, which is usually employed by large private investors and pension funds, is to hold shares directly; in the institutional environment many clients who own portfolios have what are called segregated funds, as opposed to or in addition to the pooled mutual fund alternatives.
